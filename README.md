Imbroglio
=========

Roguelike programmed in pygame/python

This code should run perfectly fine under python 2.7 and the latest version of pygame. Excuse the mess, I'm still working on neating this stuff up and figuring out how github works!

new_test.py will show the random dungeon generator; imbroglio.py is the main game. Advice, criticism, and general help of all sorts is absolutely welcome.
